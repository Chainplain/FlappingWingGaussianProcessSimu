# FlappingWingGaussianProcessSimu
Here we use https://github.com/Chainplain/Flap_Gaussian_Process to obtain the Non-parametrc model.
Leveraging the non-parametric GPR model derived from active learning, 
we propose an optimization-based control strategy that utilizes acquired knowledge to refine actuator inputs.

The simulation shares the same paradigm as https://github.com/Chainplain/FlappingwingSimu.
And following the installation process https://github.com/Chainplain/FlappingwingSimu#installation here.
